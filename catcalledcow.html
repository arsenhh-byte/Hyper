                          Music is a kind of art that combines vocal or instrumental sounds
                           for aesthetic beauty or emotional expression, typically in accordance with cultural norms for harmony, melody, and rhythm.

                        <p>Every human community is infused with music in one way or another. 
                          There are so many different types of modern music that it is mind-boggling, some of them created in more recent times, some in earlier ones. 
                          Music is a versatile art form that lends itself well to symbiotic relationships with both verbal and physical movement, as in song and dance. 
                          Music has always been a significant complement to ritual and drama and has been recognized for its ability to both reflect and affect human emotion. 
                          Radio, film, television, musical theater, and the Internet are some of the most prominent examples of how popular culture has continuously taken advantage of these opportunities today.
                           The implications of music's use in psychotherapy, geriatrics, and advertising reflect a belief in its capacity to influence behavior.</p>
                           <p>Music influences my life in many diffrent ways:</p>
                           <p>My Social life revolves around music</p>
                           <p>My main source of entertainment is music</p>
                           <p>My Fashion sense is deeply influenced by music</p>
                           <p>It articulates art in ways I can't even find the words to explain</p>
